Mark Zuckerberg Founder and CEO , Meta Great to see Gemini 1.5 pro top the new Scale SEAL leaderboard for adversarial robustness! Congrats to the entire Gemini team\u2026and the AI safety team for leading the charge on building in robustness to our models as a core capability. Thanks to the Scale AI team for doing the vital work to create these rigorous benchmarks, the field needs more great work on topics like this Demis Hassabis CEO , Deepmind Nice, a serious contender to LMSYS in evaluating LLMs has entered the chat: SEAL Leaderboards. LLM evals are improving, but not so long ago their state was very bleak, with qualitative experience very often disagreeing with quantitative rankings.\nGood evals are very difficult to build\u2026They have to be comprehensive, representative, of high quality, and measure gradient signal, and there are a lot of details to think through and get right before your qualitative and quantitative assessments line up. \u2026Good evals are unintuitively difficult, highly work-intensive, but quite important, so I'm happy to see more organizations join the effort to do it well. Andrej Karpathy Founder , EurekaLabsAI Scale is doing an amazing job providing high-quality uncontaminated evals, now with code and instruction following! Noam Brown Member of Technical Staff , OpenAI We\u2019re going to need a lot more investment in high-quality evals and benchmarks to help us understand the actual comparative utility of the various models. This new set of private evals and leaderboards from Scale are great to see Nat Friedman Entrepreneur and Investor , and Former CEO of GitHub Scale is certified compliant with the following industry best practice standards and frameworks The future of your industry starts\u00a0here.
