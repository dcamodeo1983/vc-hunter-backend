However, access to complete, high-signal data remains a limiting factor, given steep data provider fees, inflexible schemas, AI hallucinations, and scattered, inconsistent, and mutating sources. Customers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be data scientists to recognize shovel-ready datasets, but if they need to be data scientists to generate them reliably, data will always be rate-limiting. \n\n\n\n\nPosts\nApril 9, 2025\nQuantifying the Impact of GenAI Developer Tools\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widely agreed that GenAI will transform software development, and GenAI dev tools have emerged as cornerstones of 8VC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio and broader AI productivity thesis. Up to now, however, hard data on the scale and specifics of this shift have been missing from the equation. In competitive industries, the speed and efficiency gains promised by GenAI coding tools could well mean the difference between market leadership and obsolescence. Companies can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to select the wrong tools and end up on the wrong side of the AI adoption curve.\n\n\n\n\nNews\nPosts\nApril 8, 2025\nGlimpse's $10M Series A to Rescue CPG Margins\nFor many consumers, the grocery aisle is the avatar of post-COVID inflation. Even as headline inflation has cooled (from 9.1% in June of 2022 to 2.8% in February of 2025), food prices remain stubbornly high, driving popular perceptions of gouging. $10 egg cartons, once confined to artisanal producers in Portland who know every hen by name, have hit big box stores. But grocery is a famously low-margin industry, and for CPG brands, the cost of doing business can be prohibitive.\u00c2\u00a0\nDiscover more\nview Resources\nview resouRceS\nPosts\n#\nview\nview \nWhitepapers\n#\nview\nview \nPodcasts\n#\nview\nview \nVideo\n#\nview\nview \n[8VC News]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
